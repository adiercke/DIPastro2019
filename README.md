In order to setup the repository and the exercises a working Anaconda is assumed. Install for the operating system of your choice by following the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

After that clone this repository by either using `git clone` or by downloading a zip-snapshot.

After that go into the directory and execute `conda env create -f environment.yml` in order to obtain an environment which will contain all the right versions and dependencies for this course. Unless the environment will be updated, you do not need to execute this again. Then type `conda activate dip2019` followed by `jupyter notebook .` . Navigate to the exercise folder, open the notebook and start hacking away.
